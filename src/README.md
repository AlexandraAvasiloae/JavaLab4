## Compulsory (1p)

```
(done)Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have at least the following classes: Student, School and the main class.
(done)Create all the objects in the example using streams.
(done)Create a list of students, using LinkedList implementation. Sort the students, using a comparator.
(done)Create a set of schools, using a TreeSet implementation. Make sure that School objects are comparable.
(done)Create two maps (having different implementations) describing the students and the school preferences and print them on the screen.

OUTPUT:

Student preferences are: 
{Student{name='S0'}=[School{name='H0', capacity=3}, School{name='H1', capacity=2}, School{name='H2', capacity=7}], Student{name='S1'}=[School{name='H0', capacity=3}, School{name='H1', capacity=2}, School{name='H2', capacity=7}], Student{name='S2'}=[School{name='H0', capacity=3}, School{name='H1', capacity=2}], Student{name='S3'}=[School{name='H0', capacity=3}, School{name='H2', capacity=7}]}
School preferences are: 
{School{name='H0', capacity=3}=[Student{name='S3'}, Student{name='S0'}, Student{name='S1'}, Student{name='S2'}], School{name='H1', capacity=2}=[Student{name='S0'}, Student{name='S2'}, Student{name='S1'}], School{name='H2', capacity=7}=[Student{name='S0'}, Student{name='S1'}, Student{name='S3'}]}

Process finished with exit code 0
